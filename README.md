# Novel Ideas For ES
This project tries to define a set of improvements to encourage Evolution Strategy (ES) policy to seek a better solution and reduce the tendency to plateau.

The code in this repository is the implementation for our paper: [Novel Ideas For ES](https://github.com/nagmo/Canonical_ES_Atari/blob/master/article/when%20AI%20Gets%20Bored.pdf)
